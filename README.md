# Playwright Practice #

This is a testing project I created from scratch as a part of the Udemy course I'm currently working through to improve my overall knowledge and skills with test automation.

### It includes: ###
* selector-test-suite.spec.ts: Contains tests that are written to verify https://demoqa.com/text-box UI functionality, ensuring the output matches the input values. 
* smoke-test-suite.spec.ts: Contains smoke tests to verify checkbox functionality (at https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/checkboxes) and drag and drop functionality (at https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/drag-and-drop).
* auth-test.spec.ts: Contains an authentication test for a fake banking website (https://parabank.parasoft.com) which programatically enters and saves the login info from the first test in order to re-use it for the following test.

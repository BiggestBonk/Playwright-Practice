This is a testing project I created from scratch as a part of the Udemy course I'm currently working through to improve my knowledge and skills with test automation. 
It includes e2e tests that are written to verify https://demoqa.com/text-box UI functionality, as well as smoke tests for https://demoqa.com/checkboxes and https://demoqa.com/drag-and-drop
